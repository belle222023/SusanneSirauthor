        <h3>The Fortune Cookie</h3>
        <p>I drove my 1965 candy apple red mustang convertible into my garage. When I looked up I saw a scare crow or maybe what looked like a ghost tied to the lamppost across the street. As I stared at it further I noticed it was human and not moving. A fortune cookie is at the bottom of this.</p>

        <h3>We Clean Up</h3>
        <p>Inga, a United Airlines stewardess, continues to have that curious Georgi Girl nature that puts her in danger. She becomes involved in two murders and a jewelry scheme that is, “cleaning up” in the Shores. A real cold case Miami murder is solved by Blondie.</p>

        <h3>Six Hands</h3>
        <p>Rings of young people were traveling in threes, they had been trained in the art of robbery in Italy. We heard a scream. A woman yelled, “That girl just stole my purse.” That time, they had been successful but Minkee (an adorable monkey) was in hot pursuit on his mini Harley.</p>

        <h3>Christmas Stories</h3>
        <p>Anyone can write a Christmas card. Author Susanne Sir came up with a better idea: write stories that express the holiday season’s magic. This book is filled with true and sometimes fictional tales, all tied to God’s love. Sir includes adorable animals in each story.</p>

        <h3>Review Highlight</h3>
        <p>“A plethora of imaginative characters of assorted species. A nonsensical tale that leads you to your crazy place. So let go and enjoy.....From another stew who left her footsteps in the sky.”<br>— Judi Fleming, fellow stew and friend.</p>
        <p>Yes, this is the one and only, my favorite flying partner. “Let’s do the Twist.” Still stepping high.</p>
