      <h3>What do you want readers to know about you?</h3>
      <p>I live on a private lake. It has an island in the middle with a beautiful ficus tree. This tree attracts lots of Everglades wild life. Sitting in our living room and looking out on the lake is tranquil. It is also very interesting since everyone’s back yard faces into the lake. A great setting for a story. I am a writer at heart.</p>     
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>What inspired you to become a writer?</h3>
      <p>It was a way for me to re-leave the pressures of a busy life style. My parents would take me to the Saturday afternoon matinee. I would see all these beautiful stars wearing beautiful costumes. Big technicolor screen. Always a happy ending. I would leave the theater refreshed unburdened by my problems. I was ready for another day. I would like to leave my readers with that gift.</p>    </div>

    <div class="bio-card red-card">
      <h3>What was your inspiration for your books?</h3>
      <p>When I broke my leg and was being waited on hand and foot, my husband suggested this would be a great time for me to write the book I was always talking about. I always heard write what you know about. I was a 1960 iconic stewardess. My Heroine in the book became a stewardess. I live in Miami Shores, Florida and have many animal friends with personalities. The animals went in the book. I only read mysteries. It was a natural for the series.</p>    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>How has your personal life influenced your writing?</h3>
      <p>My husband was a big supporter. He converted his truck into what was fondly referred to as the, “Book Mobile.” Including flashing yellow lights and magnetic signs advertising the cover of my book. He also liked to lay on the horn when we arrived somewhere. If we were parked at a restaurant patrons would come in asking for us or wave as we drove by on the street. It added a little laughter to their day.</p>    </div>

    <div class="bio-card red-card">
      <h3>What authors or books have influenced your writing style the most?</h3>
      <p>Janet Evanovich, Carl Hiassen, Dave Barry, Edna Buchanan, Nancy Drew Mysteries, Lawrence Sanders, ABC murders, Tim Dorsey. All mysteries and mostly humorous. My writing style has been compared to many of them.</p>    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>What’s a surprising fact about you that readers might not expect?</h3>
      <p>I was a 1960 Stewardess icon. A cheerleader before you needed to do aerobics. My first book was published when I was 75 years old.</p>    </div>
    
      <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>What themes or messages do you often explore in your work?</h3>
      <p>Humor, characters, tropics, romance, animals and of course a mystery. I also like to include community events and a portion of vivid imagination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card red-card">
      <h3>What inspired you to write your latest book and what made it unique?</h3>
      <p>My Christmas Stories book. I always felt that a Christmas letter xeroxed and included in your Christmas card was very impersonal. I wanted to do something different. So I wrote a Christmas story every year about an animal on our lake. I tried to make it a true story with God’s love and humor. Maybe a little fiction thrown in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>What do you want your readers to remember about you or your work long after they’ve finished your book?</h3>
      <p>Many who live here in the Shores like to try and name the characters and places. Someone once told me they knew every person I wrote about. I found that interesting since the book is fiction. Mostly my readers love the characters and the humor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card red-card">
      <h3>How do your personal values or beliefs shape the stories you tell?</h3>
      <p>I look at the world as Gods beautiful creation. I am a cozy person. Non violent. A great imagination. Enjoying those around me and their individual talents. I look for humorous events.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>How do you want to engage with your readers?</h3>
      <p>I want them to pick up my book for as long as their break permits. Absorb themselves in the book, chapter by chapter. Walk away refreshed and burden free. A little smile on their lips.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card red-card">
      <h3>Do you have any hobbies or interests that influence your writing?</h3>
      <p>I love people. I am the president of the Friendly Villagers. Myself and my board have built a small club into one that is getting the communities attention. Extending friendship to all. A great lunch, speaker and networking opportunities. Offering 22 grants last year back into the community and 4 scholarships of $1000.00 each to graduating seniors. Our membership has grown to over 160 members. I actually joined the club to promote my book.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-card white-card">
      <h3>What upcoming projects or releases should readers know about?</h3>
      <p>I enjoy engaging with my readers. I ask them to write a review. Good or bad. I will publish it in my next book. Just as they wrote it. I award their efforts with a free copy of my next book.</p>
